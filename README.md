# Mentor Meeting, Thursday 8/30

## Mission and Vision

### Entrepreneurship Award 2017

FIRST Team 2500 Herobotics strives to change the face of science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM), by inspiring underrepresented youth to reach for new heights, discover their limitless potential, and pursue their dreams. We show that anyone, regardless of who they are, can follow their interests in STEM. All it takes is tenacity, passion, and a solid blueprint for their future. Through numerous business and community partnerships over the last ten years, we have built the momentum that helps FIRST grow. By breaking down barriers and giving urban youth the tools to succeed, we are elevating diversity and inclusion in FIRST and building the future generation of engineers, creators, and leaders.
